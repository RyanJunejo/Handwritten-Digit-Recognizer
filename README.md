# Handwritten Digit Recognizer with TensorFlow


## Overview

This repository contains a handwritten digit recognizer built using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark in the field of machine learning. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on the input image.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Model:** The core of the project is a deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning library.
  
- **MNIST Dataset:** The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

- **Data Preprocessing:** The input data is normalized to enhance the training process.
  
- **Neural Network Architecture:** The model architecture includes flattening the 2D input into a 1D layer, followed by densely connected layers and a softmax output layer.

- **Load and Evaluate:** The code includes loading a pre-trained model, evaluating its performance on test data, and making predictions on user-provided digit images.
