# Handwritten Digit Recognizer with TensorFlow


## Overview

This repository contains a handwritten digit recognizer built using TensorFlow. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, a widely-used benchmark in the field of machine learning. The goal is to accurately classify handwritten digits (0-9) based on the input image.

## Features

- **TensorFlow Model:** The core of the project is a deep learning model implemented using TensorFlow, a powerful open-source machine learning library.
  
- **MNIST Dataset:** The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 28x28 grayscale images of handwritten digits.

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** The architecture employs a CNN to effectively capture spatial hierarchies in the input images, enhancing the recognition accuracy.

- **Accuracy and Performance:** The model's performance is evaluated in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency to ensure practical usability.
